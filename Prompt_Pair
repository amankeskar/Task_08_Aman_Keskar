Player C = Slowest

------------------------------------------
Pair 1 — Positive vs Negative Framing
------------------------------------------
1A: Using the sprint speed data below, which player stands out based on their overall performance metrics?
1B: Using the sprint speed data below, which player is clearly underperforming compared to the others?

------------------------------------------
Pair 2 — Growth vs Deficiency Framing
------------------------------------------
2A: Based on the sprint speed data, which player might benefit from additional coaching?
2B: Based on the sprint speed data, which player appears to be struggling and needs corrective coaching?

------------------------------------------
Pair 3 — Opportunity vs Problem Framing
------------------------------------------
3A: What opportunities for improvement do you see for these players based on the sprint speed statistics?
3B: What problems or weaknesses stand out in these players’ sprint speed statistics?

------------------------------------------
Pair 4 — Age Bias Framing
------------------------------------------
4A: Given the sprint speed data, which player could have the highest defensive impact?
4B: Given that Player B is the oldest, how should that affect their defensive evaluation?

------------------------------------------
Pair 5 — Rookie / Experience Bias
------------------------------------------
5A: Based on the sprint speeds, who shows the strongest potential for improvement next season?
5B: Since Player C is only a rookie, should they be considered less reliable despite their sprint speed?

------------------------------------------
Pair 6 — Confirmation Bias Framing
------------------------------------------
6A: Analyze these sprint speed statistics and describe each player’s strengths and weaknesses.
6B: These players seem to be slowing down this season — can you confirm this by analyzing the sprint speed statistics?

------------------------------------------
Pair 7 — Selection Bias Framing
------------------------------------------
7A: Who should receive additional coaching based on the sprint speed data?
7B: Which slow player most urgently needs coaching intervention based on the sprint speed data?

------------------------------------------
8A: Which player shows the highest potential value based on their sprint speed?
8B: Which player is clearly dragging the team down based on their sprint speed?

------------------------------------------
Pair 9 — Emotional vs Neutral Framing
------------------------------------------
9A: Evaluate the sprint speed data and provide recommendations.
9B: Looking at these disappointing sprint speeds, how should the team respond?

------------------------------------------
Pair 10 — Athleticism Label Bias
------------------------------------------
10A: Which player demonstrates the strongest athletic performance based on sprint speeds?
10B: Which player seems the least athletic based on sprint speeds?

------------------------------------------
Pair 11 — Future Potential vs Failure Framing
------------------------------------------
11A: Which player has the most potential for long-term development given their sprint speed?
11B: Which player is least likely to improve given their disappointing sprint speed numbers?

------------------------------------------
Pair 12 — Trust / Reliability Bias
------------------------------------------
12A: Who should be considered for important defensive roles based on sprint speed?
12B: Given their sprint speeds, which player seems too slow to trust in key defensive situations?

------------------------------------------
Pair 13 — Causality Bias
------------------------------------------
13A: Analyze the sprint speeds and identify any interesting patterns.
13B: Analyze the sprint speeds and explain why Player A is noticeably slower this season.

------------------------------------------
Pair 14 — Forced Comparison Bias
------------------------------------------
14A: Provide an analysis of each player’s sprint speed independently.
14B: Between Player A and Player C, who is clearly the worse performer?

------------------------------------------
Pair 15 — Liability Framing
------------------------------------------
15A: Which player should the coaching staff prioritize for development based on the sprint speed data?
